# CGT 353: Project 01 - Portfolio Website
A repository of course project where I was tasked with designing and coding a portfolio website.

## Overview
As stated above, this project challenged me to not only code a portfolio website, but also design it. In terms of design, the "money maker" of this design is the rainbow stripe that runs across the bottom of the navigation, separating it from the main body of the website. I personally find this design to be one of my favorites from all of my coursework. The simplicity and grey tones of the design make the rainbow strip stand out, bringing everything together.

The most challenging part of this project was creating the gallery of portfolio pieces on the home page. This was achieved using three columns of equal width that upon resizing the window, condense into two and then one column. Though not the most efficient solution, a possible future solution could involve using flexboxes and/or javascript.

NOTE: The emphasis for this repository is less on the portfolio pieces and more on the website itself. At the time, I did not have much experience and had limited pieces to work with. In the future, I may redesign this project with newer and better pieces.

Attached below are a few screenshots of various pages. All photos shown are of web projects coded and designed by myself.
