                        <p class="projects-item projects-item-body">As Communication Co-Chair for Purdue's Queer Students of Color (QSOC), I was tasked with creating a flyer/poster advertising a guest speaker. For this flyer, I was asked to keep the focus on the speaker's face; thus, I vertically centered the speaker's face. I was also provided a short biography, which I placed near the bottom of the flyer in smaller font as it was not as high of priority as the other information. When looking at the flyer, the first elements that catch your attention are the image of the speaker and her name, which is the intended effect. I was not given a specific color scheme to follow so I chose to use a pastel colors to contrast the dark photo of the speaker, making it stand out even more. A small element I incorporated was a series of lines connecting the central image to the title and biography. This was done in order to help visually guide the viewer's eye through the poster. Finally, I put the time and date of the event in an asymmetric area that the reader can easily see after viewing the rest of the information. I used Adobe Illustrator to create the flyer and <a class="body-link" href="https://www.paletton.com" target="_blank">paletton.com</a> to help with adjusting the color scheme.</p>

                        <p class="projects-item projects-item-body">As Communication Co-Director for Purdue Immigrant Allies (PIA), I was tasked with creating a social media flyer for a rally event. PIA has an established color scheme, consisting of dark red, gold, and black; thus, I worked to incorporate this color scheme into the flyer to further establish the connection the organization. The theme for the event was serious/stern which I incorporated into the flyer with dark colors, bold/large fonts, and a fitting image. One aspect that was important to consider while designing was the aspect ratio. As this was a flyer intended to be posted on social media (such as Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter), it was imperative to use a social media friendly aspect ratio, which was 1:1 in this case. After consulting with the president of Purdue Immigrant Allies, I created various revisions of the flyer until it was approved. I used Adobe Illustrator to create the flyer and <a class="body-link" href="https://www.paletton.com" target="_blank">paletton.com</a> to help with adjusting the color scheme.</p>

I was told to keep the design of the flyer simple and to make the date, time, and location easily readible. With this in mind, I used a color scheme that Purdue Immigrant Allies has established and created a simple geometric flyer. Because I was asked to emphasize the date and time, I placed it in the center of the flyer with a colored bounding box to ensure it stands out to the viewer.
