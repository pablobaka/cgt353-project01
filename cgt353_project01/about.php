                    <p class="about-item">I am a Chicago based junior at Purdue University studying Web Programming & Design and Data Visualization. I grew up in Northwest Indiana, roughly 20 minutes from Chicago as the youngest child of four. Growing up, I was always encouraged to "reach for the golden key" by my parents, a metaphor that I would later come to understand meant success in life. I learned that there is not just one golden key, but many golden keys in life &ndash; the first of which being high school graduation and the next being college graduation. All of these life experiences have shaped who I am on both a personal and professional level.</p>

                    <p class="about-item">As a first generation college student, I have strong drive to make a name for myself in the web development industry. I strive to use industry standard practices to create meaningful and insightful web pages. Though I am open to all scenarios of web design and data visualization, my primary focus lies in bringing insight to marginalized communities, such as immigrants and the LGBTQ+ community. This is reflected in my Poltical Science minor, executive position in my university's immigrant advocacy organization, and research on HIV/AIDS. Given my abilities and opportunities, I find it to be my duty to use these abilities and opportunities to bring insight and advocacy to these groups that may not be able to on their own.</p>
